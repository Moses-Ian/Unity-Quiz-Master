## Purpose

This is my third game that I built while learning Unity. It focuses on the UI elements.

This game is broken. The tutorial used a coding style that I vehemently disagree with. The build also just generates a blue image because at no point did they teach me how to actually build it properly. I've been winging it up to this point, and obviously UI has some extra requirement that I can't figure out.

Overall, this tutorial was extremely frustrating. Lots of things, like TextMeshPro, just /worked/ in his version that I had to fiddle with. It was boring and long and I hated it, so I skipped the last two sections. Hopefully the next chapter will be better.

## Credits

The assets and core ideas were given to me as part of the Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D course on Udemy.
